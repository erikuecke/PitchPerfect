Fixes for 01submitPitchPerfect

1) Fixed recordingLabel: UILabel from dissapearing in landscapte mode for iPhone SE

2) Adjusted constraint in for different size screen in landscape and portrait for overall better layout.

3) Applied this code in Play Sounds view Controller's  viewDidLoad() to fix sound effects buttons from quishing in iPhone SE landscape mode.  

		let arrayOfButtons = [snailButton, chipmunkButton, rabbitButton, vaderButton, echoButton, reverbButton]

    	for button in arrayOfButtons {
        	button.imageView?.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
    	}

4) Removed viewWillAppear() from RerorcSoundViewController. Not function or method implemented with it.
